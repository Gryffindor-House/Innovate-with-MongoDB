We have developed a web application for spotting and plotting shipwrecks around the world. By logging in to our website, you can access our comprehensive dashboard and view all the shipwreck sites via a map and side by side is a wreck info form which you can fill up to add to our ever expanding database.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start in client/my-app directory`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `nodemon app.js in server directory`

Runs just the client app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the server in the browser.


### `npm run-script server`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
